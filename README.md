# OpenLipidBilayer

This repository contains the software for an article [HOGEHOGE](https://www.kikagaku.ai/).

## Currently dealing with
- [x] github upload
- [ ] Github modify
- [ ] hogehoge


## Requirements
* Currently, only adaptable to a large-conductance nanopore (e.g. alpha-hemolysin) 
or a large-conductance ion channel (e.g. big pottasium channel).
* upgrading will be appriciated.
* This is an image ![histogram](/Assets/capture.PNG)



## Installation

### Microsoft Visual Studio 2019


### Qt


### Tecella PICO and TecellaAmp API





### Arduino and peripherals 


### Software Setup
* Qt setting
* TecellaAmp modification



### Hardware Setup
* Arduino



## How to Use


### Experimental
* setup the device.
* Lipid bilayer environment

* start the software.
*  


### Analysis
* already in the log/ folder.
* open CSV and create histogram.




## How to Modify
### Changing proteins
* name
* conductance
* 


### Changing Amplifier
* change TecellaAmpExample_00.cpp to something provided by a manufacturer.
* The measuerment.cpp is wrapper.



### Changing postprocessing actuation
* change the "1Hz " function in the MyMain.cpp


### Changing UI
* change the initialize_graph / start_graph / 1Hz funtion in the MyMain.cpp
* Change the MyMain.ui
